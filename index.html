        </div>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>
            Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is one of the most vital crops in Bangladesh but is highly susceptible to early blight. (Chothani, et al., 2017) found that early blight severity increases significantly under higher temperature (35-38°C), lower evening humidity (30-58%), and moderate wind speed (1.2–2.2 km/h). Relative humidity more than 90% for 5 to 6 hours accelerates spore germination. (Cowgill, et al., 2005) Weather data can be used to predict early blight as the fungal activity majorly depends on the environment.<br><br>
            To combat this significant agricultural challenge, our team is developing an advanced predictive model for Early Blight. Our approach aims to empower farmers with timely, data-driven insights for disease management. The main objective of this study is to develop an AI-powered early warning system that predicts the risk of early blight in potato crops using real-time microclimatic data from a portable mini weather station.<br><br>
            We've focused on creating a solution that is both practical and scalable, ensuring it can be effectively deployed across diverse farming conditions in Bangladesh. This not only promotes precise disease management decisions but also supports environmental sustainability by potentially reducing the indiscriminate use of fungicides.<br><br>
            <li>Practical and scalable solution for managing early blight in potatoes was designed and implemented.</li>
            <li>Precise, data-driven decision-making was promoted through this approach, supporting environmental stability.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>
            The farmers of Bangladesh face substantial financial setbacks each year due to inadequate methods for assessing and managing fruit quality. Postharvest losses for fruits in the country are alarmingly high, ranging from 25% to 50% of total production, severely impacting both farmer incomes and the national economy. According to recent studies, the gross monetary loss from poor postharvest handling of fruits in Bangladesh is estimated at Tk. 6,120 to 8,160 million annually. These losses are particularly severe for key fruits like Mango (39.38%), Banana (26.63%), Jackfruit (32%) and Brinjal (22%).<br><br>
            At the root of this crisis is the lack of accessible technology and limited awareness among farmers regarding critical quality parameters and proper handling techniques. Assessing internal quality factors like sugar content, acidity, firmness or oil content farmers are forced to rely on manual inspection methods that are often inaccurate and destructive.<br><br>
            This project aims to develop an affordable, portable spectroscopic solution that enables non-destructive fruit quality analysis, empowering farmers with the tools they need to make smarter, more profitable decisions.<br><br>
            <li>Vis-NIR Spectroscopy was utilized to enable non-destructive assessment of internal fruit quality.</li>

        <div class="project-details">
          <p>
            This is a design of a system that uses an Arduino to intelligently control motors based on input from either an IR Remote or a Soil Moisture Sensor. Think of it as the brain behind a potential Robot or an Automated Watering System. In fact, this setup also functions as a remote-controlled Robot Car, allowing for manual field navigation to check soil moisture and precisely water specific areas. The LCD Screen provides real-time feedback, making the system interactive and informative.<br><br>
            Key Functionalities:
          <li>Soil moisture levels are monitored by this system.</li>
          <li>Automatic water pump activation is enabled when moisture levels fall below a defined threshold.</li>
          <li>Manual navigation of the Robot Car is facilitated via an IR Remote for checking soil conditions and watering specific areas.</li>
